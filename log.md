**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 08 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've created Weather API from open weathermap public API.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding on JS, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve a real challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
